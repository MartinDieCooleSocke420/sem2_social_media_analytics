Our expectations were not fulfilled at all. We ordered our food, I ordered welldone beef and water. I went to the bathroom, and when I got back our drinks had arrived. I took a sip of my water, and found out it was sparkling water. I talked to the waiter and said, that there had happend a mistake, but then he said no no you asked for water and water in Germany is sparkling water and if I like to, then he could shake all the bobles out. WTF?! 
That is not good service. Just bring me a new one and you‚Äôve got a happy customer. The water was San Pellegrino 0,75L for 5,90 EUR. 
We got our food, my beef were not welldone. I told the water, they cooked it some more and gave it back. Cooked meant grill on both sides so it was black (!) and actually a bit red inside still. We had 4 different waiters, and not one of them asked about how our food was. Both steaks were not tender. 

No tips were earned. What a bad experience in Kiel. We really enjoy good service (and of course really good food) and would like to give tips when it is fulfilled. Unfortunatly it was not tonight. Not at all. What a shame :(.",2.0

Here is a tip to the restaurant: You have pint size beer glasses - you serve your weisbeer in these. Why can't we have a man sized pilsner in a pint glass. Men don't drink small beers. Why? We just don't get it. We asked for a pilsner to be poured into a weisbeer glass but was refused.

After a few private words with the lady about our whereabouts and which hotel in Hamburg has send us to Deck 8 we where send up to the bar. This incidence alone was already displeasing.

Our food was perfect, asparagus from Schleswig-Holstein is just the right food for May. Since we are living in Norway, there is seldom a chance to get to taste the white asparagus made the right way with hollandaise and potatoes - everybody thinks the green is better.....but it is NOT.

Not to forget the home made hollandaise sauce - it was exquisit and definitely made from scratch.

The omellette/waffle station was quite good and also served fresh eggs to order individually if you'd rather those instead of an omelette. Next to this station was a good selection of hot breakfast meats including American bacon, European sausages and meat pies.

There was a cold bar with a nice selection of sliced meats and cheeses, also herring and smoked salmon.

The bread selection was varied and also featured fresh pastries. A detail I appreciate is the availability of napkins to hold the bread as you slice it fresh rather than having slices out and exposed to air or having guests grasp the bread with bare hands.

The tea and coffee area had a nice selection of teas in fiber pouches and a little honey station to dispense honey in edible cups. The selection of honeys was also nice, three different types.",5.0

We were super jet lagged and decided to eat at Pier 16 as we were staying at the Atlantic Hotel and didn't want to go searching for food elsewhere.

This was our first meal in Germany and we were really impressed! The portions were generous and the food quality was fresh. Our server was attentive and friendly and offered her suggestions on what to order and answered our questions. She was very knowledgeable about the menu. We loved her sense of humor when I wanted dessert but my husband didn't but said he'd take a few bites of mine. She ended up bringing him one of those ""extend a forks"" so he could sneak bites and I wouldn't have to move the plate. To our jet lagged, foggy brains we found this way funnier than it probably was but it made for a nice memory. It's to bad we were too tired to think of getting a picture.

Since we stayed at the hotel we also ate breakfast here and were really impressed with the selection and variety of items offered. I loved the honey dispenser and mini ice cream cones. We also really enjoyed the pastries and teas.

Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at this restaurant and would recommend it.",5.0

We started with asking the waitress for two glasses of sparkling wine. This was delivered only 15 minutes later. After ordering the food, we waited 50 minutes for the starters (in the meantime, we got two kinds of antipasti on the house).
Ordering the food, I asked the waitress about wine recommendation for our main dishes. She suggested a wine which I didn't know, but I accepted her suggestion. Now, when serving the wine, the right procedure would have been to show me the label on the bottle, letting me test it, pour it into our glasses and put it on the table. Instead, the waitress arrived with the bottle, poured it into our glasses and put the bottle out of our sight. When our glasses were empty, I had to go and look for the bottle.

The building is on the edge of the Christmas market now on in Kiel, and proved to be very old inside where original features had been preserved. The dining area is split into several individual spaces, giving a cosy feel.
The waiters are quite mature,have obviously been doing this a long time and inspire confidence with their easy expertise.
Fortunately our companions speak good German and were able to interpret the menu for us. I chose potato soup and it was surprisingly tasty, although no bread was served with it.
For mains I had venison, my companions had duck.All the portions were generous, especially the meat and sides included two types of dumpling and fried potatoes.
The meat was superbly well cooked and was washed down with a bottle of Rioja and good German beer.
This was an excellent experience although I can see that as visitors this was very new to us, wheras residents no doubt get fed up of a steady procession of pork, sausages and potatoes which seems to be the normal German diet.
We had two starters, four mains three beers and a bottle of wine.

We had some cheese after that and it was presented very nicely on the plate.
Our waitress on Saturday was a real pleasure to watch working, professional and gave the impression that she enjoyed her work. Nice to see and unfortunately the staff wears mo name tags so I could pass it on her for her to know that what she does works.

Apparently its normal here to eat out rather than cook at home, as disposable income is quite high, hence the need to book anywhere other than fast food well in advance.
Pizza seemed a strange choice but the place was buzzing, at 7 pm and we cheerfully spent some time at the aluminium topped bar eating our way through the huge baskets of pistachios and chugging the excellent German beer.
We were seated and attended to by the excellent staff.
There is an open view of the kitchen and the activity in there never dropped.
The pizzas are huge and on a very thin and crispy base. All four of us chose to go half and half on our toppings and the food was delicious.
The ambience is very good, all sorts of people, all ages, all happy and well behaved.
The cost for four, with drinks was 70e which seemed very reasonable.
OK pizza can be the same anywhere, but they do have other Italian dishes and starters.We did try a traditional German restaurant the next night, but apart from fast food the typical offerings in restaurants here are pork,sausages and potatoes with very little in the way of spice.

I ordered the mussels and was really looking forward to them but 20 minutes later the waitress came out and said there was none left. Fair enough, these things happen! I ordered something else although I was disappointed. Our starters eventually came out and were tasty, I had the bruschetta. Well, before I'd received my main the waitress brought out a huge bowl of the mussels I had ordered for someone else who had come in 30 minutes after us! Just seems odd that I hadn't received my food yet, they knew I wanted the mussels and was visibly disappointed when there were none left and they didn't offer me them again when they managed to miraculously find some.

Al Gambero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d1345299-Reviews-Al_Gambero-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,Down to earth lunchtime food,"The Al Gambero restaurant and pizzeria is an Italian establishment situated centrally in the main shopping area of the Kiel suburb of Friedrichsort, some 8 km north of the city centre. We visited at lunchtime in April 2014 and found a real hive of activity. We were lucky to find a free table for two almost immediately, as most of the tables in both dining areas were already taken, mostly by local workers from the nearby engineering factories, judging by their huge appetite and their capacity to eat mountains of freshly-cooked pasta dishes. This is certainly no refined restaurant. But it reflects the local requirement for somewhere relatively inexpensive to get a quickly prepared and tasty lunch. As is the rule generally in this part of Germany, people like to be served quickly and to eat as quickly as possible before leaving for their afternoon employment. So, don‚Äôt expect any refined conversations with the serving staff, who rapidly and efficiently get on with their job of serving hot food and a glass of something to drink.
A word on the restaurant: tables are of the bare wooden type, no decoration is provided and napkins are of the paper variety. No candles or elegant glassware. Cutlery is limited to what is strictly necessary for pasta dishes, a spoon and a fork. But it is spotlessly clean. The menu is adequately furnished, with several Italian pasta dishes along with a range of pizzas, all of which appeared to be freshly prepared. My spaghetti with diced ham, onion and tomato sauce was copious, hot and served with a side dish of baguette. I took a glass of Sardinian syrah, a heavy red wine common in southern Europe. My wife had a white wine schorle, a dry white served with mineral water to accompany her pasta dish which was served with a cheese and broccoli sauce.

Hard to know how things could have been better from both the services and the food perspective. The locals filled the place and there were lots of reserved tables so this is a popular spot for those in the know.

It really is Nr. 1,"My husband and I stayed in Kiel the night before our cruise, and this restaurant just happen to be a few blocks from our hotel. They had specials on boards lined up outside. We saw rib-eye steak with veggies, salad and bread for about 12euro, and of course my husband ordered that. The steak was about half a pound, but just enough to satisfy your steak craving. The biggest thing that stuck out to us was how the meat was cooked and tasted. PERFECT. We have lived in Germany for over 2 years now, and NOT 1 restaurant we have been to had made a steak right (its always over cooked or undercooked), until now! It was the perfect pink and so tender. The flavor of the meat was just down right AMAZING!!! No sauce, like A1 or 57 needed...pure bliss. The whole plate surprisingly filled my husband up. I ordered a salad and a baked potato with veggies. Little did I know the baked potato came with a salad. the veggies that were served on top of the potato were AMAZING, I have never tasted anything like this!!!! So wonderful! I think it was just over 5euro as well! The staff were nice, and they had good service, not to fast not too slow. They did have a menu in English and one of the ladies spoke English. So if you happen to find yourself in Kiel I would say you can't go wrong with this place!!!

I had no breakfast at my hotel and was starved and with heavy luggage Langengrad was my only option. Upon arrival I was told by the bartender that the kitchen closed at 2pm and doesn't open again until 5pm. I asked politely what sense it makes to close the kitchen in a Stenna Building restaurant when folks are waiting for boarding and then opening it after they get on the ship? I was told that they don't get many Stenna travelers in there. I hope mgt reads this because I want to ask if they've ever heard of selfulfilling prophesy? I asked if I could get anyting to eat, any snacks or chips. He said: No nothing Kitchen is closed but you are welcome to relax and have a drink and wait. Relaxing on a couch 
I was tormented by the sight of 2 or three workers coming in intervals from the kitchen with plates of food and stuffing their faces in front of me at the bar. There were only 3 other customers in the place yet it actually took half an hour before the waitress asked me if I wanted a drink. She only came back for a second trip when it was time for me to leave.As I picked up my check I noticed a hand bill on the table. It read ""Waffles available from 1400 to 1500. When the waitress returned I asked her about this and she said ""the kitchen is closed but we serve waffles between 2pm and 5pm. "" I then asked why the bartender told me nothing was available not even snacks and her reply was
""I guess he didn't understand you"". I should have asked why it takes 2 hours to get 1 beer. The only excuse for an experience like this is extremly poor management. It it is ashame because it is a beautiful place with great views but you can't eat scenery.",2.0

The restaurant is at the fourth floor of the Stena Line building - the ferry company to Gothenburg near the centre of Kiel. The environment of the restaurant is very desolate.

You go the restaurant by lift. As the restaurant is at the top floor you have quite a nice view over the harbor, but not very special. Maybe in summer on the terrace it is more challenging. They offer a lunch menu card, with app. 10 choices, very diverse. The prices are OK, very reasonable. However the food is not very special. Very standard. No special ingredients, no exciting spices. I had the Gado Gado vegetarian Indonesian food. The dressing was too less and not very special. Additionally the staff doesn't give you a warm feeling of being their most important asset: a customer.

When we got the menu, we were advised that the ""Mittagstisch"" (set lunch dish) would be quick, but that everything else on the menu would need 30+ minutes. As we were really hungry and a bit late in our schedule, we opted for what was suggested to us. This was fine although nothing special. The seitan steak was lukewarm, everything else (various salads plus chili sin carne) were cold. All tasty, but we got the feeling that a lot of it was probably left over from the previous day's Vegan ""grill fest"". We would have preferred the seitan steak to be hotter, and the chili sin carne would have been tasty warm, too. The mocktails (we had a Red Lion( cherry juice with coconut cream) and an Acapulco (various tropical juices)) were good.

The venue is not particularly remarkable, but then as long as the food is fine, who cares about a simple interior? Value for money (portions) was good. Service was friendly and prompt. Sadly, we won't be able to come back to Kiel anytime soon, but based on our experience, it might be better to come here for dinner, and when the kitchen is on full steam, so you get the full menu choice.

SO glad we did. The staff was amazing and very helpful in our selection of food to eat and explained everything to us, very well, in English.
The atmosphere was lovely and the food was delicious!  The server was amazing and very attentive.  The parking was plentiful and free (while we were there, anyways).

Hafenwirtschaft,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d5604055-Reviews-Hafenwirtschaft-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,Improving year by year,"We have been coming to the Hafenwirtschaft in Holtenau for quite a number of years now and it has become our favourite local restaurant. The service is far more reliable than that of the other restaurants we know in and around Kiel, the food is copious and  well prepared, without being in any way ostentatious. The setting reflects the maritime neighbourhood and is warm and welcoming. Seating is more comfortable in the lower area opposite the bar, so do book a table in this section if you are planning to stay for more than a quick snack.

Lunchtime meals are an excellent introduction to the Hafenwirtschaft, as there is always a wide choice of first and main courses, representative of the extensive selection available in the evening. The lunch menu offers a fixed price three course meal, which always includes a fish or meat based main course, while proposing a clearly indicated vegetarian or vegan alternative. The lunchtime price, exclusive of drinks, is currently under 20 EUR. A real bargain.

There is normally no need to reserve a table for lunch, as the seating is adequate for upward of 100 guests, but this applies only on weekdays (Tuesday to Friday). Do reserve for weekends.

While many of the recent reviews mention typical German dishes, our experience has been that more unusual international dishes have been added to the menu by the very capable chef, so do be tempted to enquire about some of the dishes you may not recognize. Some dishes have local names, but this does not detract from their quality.

If you find time to plan ahead and have a special request, speak to the management about the delicious seafood which can be obtained to order, such as crab or lobster. Well worth the wait!

Friendly and efficient service have transformed the Hafenwirtschaft. Ask for a copy of the menu in English if you feel ill at ease with the German language. One or two f the staff do speak English very well and will make you welcome.

Prices are not the lowest, but they are honest and fair. Smaller portions are offered if the generally very copious portions appear too generous. Salads are always a good bet and are delicious.

Remember that Monday is not an opening day.",4.0

Very nice!","We stumbled across this restaurant because we were moored in a nearby marina. We had no expectation of finding a decent eating establishment in the vicinity and were really pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant that exceeded our expectations to such a degree. It was the beginning of the Asparagus season when we dined here, so many of the Specials included fresh local asparagus: I had the asparagus soup with smoked salmon as a starter and my friend had the Wiener schnitzel with asparagus hollandaise - both were excellent! In fact, the entire meal was excellent!

The bread was excellent; my gin &amp; tonic was excellent; our starters were great; our main courses were brilliant; my coffee was faultless. We had a nice bottle of Malbec at a reasonable price; our waitress was lovely - and because I can't speak German she very carefully explained all the items on the menu to me. 

All in all, a great meal in very pleasant surroundings with excellent service at a reasonable price. If you are in the area you should try it - I am sure you won't be disappointed. Strongly recommended!",5.0

The food was very good and the service quick and kind.

This restaurant is located directly on the coast, in Kiel Holtenau, in one of these huge storage facilities, now transformed in apartments. The atmosphere is very 'maritime' but not kitsch. The building is very tastefully renovated. The menu includes some very traditional dishes of meat and fish, some pizzas, and some more exotic combinations such as fish curry (quite spicy actually) or a delicious fish risotto (both on the 'specials' board). My lamb fillet was excellent, juicy and perfectly cooked. Yummy desserts. The place is apparently also a good spot for coffee and cake or waffles. Ideal for big groups due to the size of the rooms. Must come back!",5.0
Hafenwirtschaft,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d5604055-Reviews-Hafenwirtschaft-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,Disappointing,"We met as a group of six friends and neighbours for supper at the recently opened Hafenwirtschaft near the Quayside in Kiel-Holtenau. Our reservation was admirably handled by the assistant manager Daniel Michel and our table was by one of the rather smallish windows with limited views to the sailing ships moored at the quay and over the entrance to the Kiel Canal beyond.
We did not wait long to place our orders, taken by a rather hesitant young man who clearly had not been long in his job, but he was polite and attentive. The choice of dishes is quite extensive, for what is basically a German restaurant. Meat and fish dishes are available, as well as pasta and children's‚Äô portions.
Disappointing! Why? Because the much vaunted Roast Beef, served in my case with pur√©e potatoes and not with fried ‚Äòbratkartoffeln‚Äô, was almost conspicuous by its absence. In other words, the portion of roast beef, although appetising enough, was miniscule. Two extremely small and thin slices of meat.
If, like me, you are used to a carvery in the UK or the USA, you will find the portions minute here in Germany. Roast beef is an expensive item here, but nowhere have I been served so little. If I say that the roast beef is served in small (4 x 3 inch) uniform slabs, but thin, you may be reminded of the corned beef slices that come out of cans. British carveries serve huge, whole slices of beef, not miserable quantities clearly not carved from a joint of beef.
Our fellow diners hesitated to say how they felt about their portions and said even less about the standard of the cuisine. Enough said.
Prices were about average, but the proposed boar was overpriced, leading to my decision to take the slightly less-expensive beef.
We did not take a dessert, but did take a coffee. With one glass of red wine each, the bill for my wife and me came to just under ‚Ç¨50. I gather that our fellow diners paid about the same sum.
The interior of the old Packhaus Restaurant, newly opened as the Hafenwirtschaft, is much as it always was, comfortable without being extravagant. It is cosy and has a newly refurbished bar/lounge area, where they serve Gin Cocktails and other beverages.
Not my first choice of restaurant in Holtenau; it needs to improve its offering.",3.0

Fuego del Sur,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d1039396-Reviews-Fuego_del_Sur-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,If you are craving some good beef...,"This might be one of your better choices near downtown, easily accessible by car or by foot across the bridge. Of course, I am now accustomed to ""real"" food, not the chemically-laced junk we somehow benignly swallow in the US, but every once in a while, I crave good beef which does not have a strong presence here in DE. When the urge hits, one of the ways to satisfy it is to make a beeline to Fuego del Sur. Although I am dismayed with the need to first feed a meter to park before I can feed myself, I've found the steak very flavorful and prepared as requested (English rare rare rare) and therefore, it's been worth it. The environment smacks a bit of ""warehouse"" since it is very spacious and rather sparsely decorated, and I've not been overwhelmed with the other selections, but neither have I been disappointed. My dinner companion enjoyed her seafood selection very much. It will surely be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try. It's usually in the ""Kiel and Umgebung"" Gutscheinebuch, if that's what it takes to get you in the door. It might become your new ""beef go to"" restaurant.",4.0

I also suggest getting John's burgers rare or medium rare so that you can fully appreciate their utter succulence.

His buns are also amazing. They're neither too hard nor too soft. They're just perfect for holding the meat in--no toothpicks are necessary.

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The lively young staff are always in good cheer and the music's fantastic.

It's also cool that they have an open kitchen and source locally as much as possible.

The Kluevers beer they have specially produced is outstanding and goes really well with the food.

Although the burgers are american style indeed, there is nothing really special with them. The angus beef was good quality but honestly the taste was very plain with no hint of flavour. It is true that good beef doesn¬¥t need much spices but at least a little bit more of salt would¬¥ve been good for this burger to actually make it much better.
The atmosphere was good, the people working there very friendly and the service was quick enough. The place is a little bit small but cosy and the decoration gives a really relaxing feeling. The music was nice and the rest of customers seemed to enjoy their time there. I liked the system with the menu where you check what your order is so the chances to get you order wrong are low.
I had higher expectations because for me food it is about the flavour, and perhaps for american people it is really their taste of home, but for me was a little to simple.

We vision a Saturday, they open at 16.30. So we started to call since 16 Try to reserve a table. Unfortunately, nobody ever picked up the phone until we actually just go there at the time that we planned to at 18.

Fully packed. The girl at the cashier was very nice, gave us menu while waiting for the next table. Apparently, they don't really find you a table, you just take whatever you see. That make me wonder why do we need reservation? ?

We got 3 seats. And we ordered at the cashier, she is such a nice girl. We paid and we tip.

Waited a reasonable period for our food. Turned out they made my orders all wrong..... I have to send it back, I was so upset that watching my friends eating and I'm waiting for them to fix my order. I asked for tomatoes inside they actually didn't put it and so just give me 2 pieces of tomatoes on the side..... that's not a matter of burger anymore.. as you have to eat the things between the bread!.

We ordered sweet potatoes fries, half of them a burnt, like black, you can taste that they are burnt. And so much salt on the sweet potato. I mean it's sweet, with so much salt on it that just doesn't make so sense to me. It's just taste weird to me.

Overall, I didn't enjoy it so much. A big disappointment, I expected a long as it has so much good review about it. The price is normal tho , but it's just not as good as everyone else say.

My husband love burgers, and he said it's nothing special about the place and burnt fries are very disappointing for him.

Owner John was flipping burgers at the grill, but made time for friendly conversation. He makes careful choices about which local farms he uses to get his meat, and he does his own bacon. Nice staff -- and more than you'd expect for such a small place. Order and pay at the counter and your food is brought to you at your table, which may be occupied by other eaters as well.

More suited to the typical German visitor than a more refined restaurant would be, Da Cosimo caters for the more hurried diner in conditions that are far from intimate, but more than acceptable. the tables are far too close to each other and space is at a premium. A good selection of international cuisine is available, with some interesting wines you might like to look up on a another occasion at the wine shop just across the street. Some Italian-sounding dishes are available, but basically this is a German restaurant with a few extra trimmings, hence the ""average"" rating in my assessment. At times, finding a table can be difficult, so if this is the place you have chosen, do make sure to have a reservation. Again, catering for German guests, this restaurant lacks the delicacy you might expect from a more up-market establishment. Do not expect anything exceptional: the food is ordinary and somewhat over-seasoned, which means that what might be good ingredients are often covered in all-enveloping sauces.

Our party may have added to that as we had to shout to each other to be heard. The acoustics was thus terrible, probably due to the interior arrangement. This was the negative side of the experience. If you can avoid an evening with shouting groups, this place will probably be rated excellent. The restaurant has a varied menu, basically Italian, with a large selection and choice of the day. I had a very good bruschetta with tomatoes before the main dish. As the main course I had the steak, which was absolutely excellent. I skipped the dessert, but from around the table I heard exclamations about the different dessert choices. We had a house wine with the food, which was fine, but not excellent.

The name was so offputting, I had no intention of even trying to find it. Then one day as I was walking, I stumbled into this cozy place quite by accident.  It's really tucked away on a corner in a residential area, but close enough to downtown to make for a very pleasant walk. I've been there many times now, and have never once been disappointed. It's classy and sophisticated, but in an understated way featuring a dark wood interior contrasted with modern silver touches, crisp white table clothes, and enough textiles to contain sound. You pass through long curtains to enter this comfortable little world.

Highlights, besides great atmosphere, include the happy hour beverages until 7:30 -- a nice price break. That's a great way to cap off a challenging day and get in the right mood for a fine meal. And, of course, the food is the real draw.  Although I've savored every meal here, recently I've been very pleased with some of the pasta choices such as the Penne with gebratenen Lammstreifen, knackigem Gem√ºse, Kr√§utern und Parmesan.  My friend really liked her Tagliatelle with Zitronen-Orangenbutter, gebratener Riesengarnele und Lachsfilet. One of my favorite entrees is the perfectly-prepared rosa gebraten Barbarie-Entenbrust mit Kr√§uterjus. And when you are in the mood for a flavorful steak, you won't be disappointed here.  A real treat for your tongue is the Gebratenes Filetsteak mit Thymianjus, saisonalem Gem√ºse und Macaire-Kartoffeln.  As usual, I asked for English temperature, and that's exactly how it came out.  I could go on, but then I would be salivating all over the computer keyboard. 

Although the service is attentive, I have never felt rushed. Staff members have been quite personable and very patient with my strange-sounding German and oft questionable grammar. 

Another highlight for me is that I can go ""dressed"" as I am -- whether I am in a fancy evening dress or jeans and a nice sweater. I've never been made to feel out of place either way. This is particularly helpful if you are tourist who has the good sense not to try to walk around Kiel in high heels, or when you are going directly from work which I highly recommend if you intend to get a table. 

In closing, this is NOT a good place for kids (Gott sei Dank!), but would be a fine place for couples, friends or even business meetings. Make a reservation first, then Guten Appetit!",5.0

The vegetarion Kartoffel was astonishing, the Lachsforelle was tastefull, juicy and 'a point'. Usually I don't like when fish is half backed, half raw but this recepy really changed my opinion.

It didn't matter what we ordered, it was always special and obvious that the Chef went the extra mile.  Salads, cassoulet, pasta, a giant hamburger, soup, tapas, you name it ... always made with the freshest ingredients and with an extra creative touch.

The view of the marina outside is more impressive though, and had the weather been a bit warmer, we would have certainly stayed outside on the large patio. We enjoyed ourselves very well and the feeling I got was that this was a three star Michelin chef's secret side project.

The only downside I could find was the English language menu, slightly confusing. But my company was German so I was fine.

I had the 250 gr. flank beef steak and it was simply put heavenly!! The steak was perfectly cooked and the ingredient was top notch. Everything on my dish was a masterpiece in and of itself. The salad (that dressing!!), aioli and the very best sweet potato french fries I've ever enjoyed! My girlfriend had tiger prawn curry that was equally delicious, if only slighty too heavy on the rice. 

A special mention has to be made of the home-made pastries. We shared a cup of ice-cream with nut toppings (Nuss-Becher) and as with everything else, perfect! If you have just enjoyed a full meal, one serving is more than enough for two.

The service was also quite attentive and welcoming. We were seated promptly and had decent intervals between the courses.

Well, before I'd received my main the waitress brought out a huge bowl of the mussels I had ordered for someone else who had come in 30 minutes after us!

Al Gambero,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d1345299-Reviews-Al_Gambero-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,Down to earth lunchtime food,"The Al Gambero restaurant and pizzeria is an Italian establishment situated centrally in the main shopping area of the Kiel suburb of Friedrichsort, some 8 km north of the city centre. We visited at lunchtime in April 2014 and found a real hive of activity. We were lucky to find a free table for two almost immediately, as most of the tables in both dining areas were already taken, mostly by local workers from the nearby engineering factories, judging by their huge appetite and their capacity to eat mountains of freshly-cooked pasta dishes. This is certainly no refined restaurant. But it reflects the local requirement for somewhere relatively inexpensive to get a quickly prepared and tasty lunch. As is the rule generally in this part of Germany, people like to be served quickly and to eat as quickly as possible before leaving for their afternoon employment. So, don‚Äôt expect any refined conversations with the serving staff, who rapidly and efficiently get on with their job of serving hot food and a glass of something to drink.
A word on the restaurant: tables are of the bare wooden type, no decoration is provided and napkins are of the paper variety. No candles or elegant glassware. Cutlery is limited to what is strictly necessary for pasta dishes, a spoon and a fork. But it is spotlessly clean. The menu is adequately furnished, with several Italian pasta dishes along with a range of pizzas, all of which appeared to be freshly prepared. My spaghetti with diced ham, onion and tomato sauce was copious, hot and served with a side dish of baguette. I took a glass of Sardinian syrah, a heavy red wine common in southern Europe. My wife had a white wine schorle, a dry white served with mineral water to accompany her pasta dish which was served with a cheese and broccoli sauce.

The menu was traditional Itallian And from what I saw the other dishes looked very good.

Hard to know how things could have been better from both the services and the food perspective. The locals filled the place and there were lots of reserved tables so this is a popular spot for those in the know.

It really is Nr. 1,"My husband and I stayed in Kiel the night before our cruise, and this restaurant just happen to be a few blocks from our hotel. They had specials on boards lined up outside. We saw rib-eye steak with veggies, salad and bread for about 12euro, and of course my husband ordered that. The steak was about half a pound, but just enough to satisfy your steak craving. The biggest thing that stuck out to us was how the meat was cooked and tasted. PERFECT. We have lived in Germany for over 2 years now, and NOT 1 restaurant we have been to had made a steak right (its always over cooked or undercooked), until now! It was the perfect pink and so tender. The flavor of the meat was just down right AMAZING!!! No sauce, like A1 or 57 needed...pure bliss. The whole plate surprisingly filled my husband up. I ordered a salad and a baked potato with veggies. Little did I know the baked potato came with a salad. the veggies that were served on top of the potato were AMAZING, I have never tasted anything like this!!!! So wonderful! I think it was just over 5euro as well! The staff were nice, and they had good service, not to fast not too slow. They did have a menu in English and one of the ladies spoke English. So if you happen to find yourself in Kiel I would say you can't go wrong with this place!!!

As far as I understand, the Forstbaumschule used to be a forestry school, hence the location. This also means that the wooden beams are decorated with gorgeous old painting of the the nature in the park.
The food was definitely value for money, feeding a family of 4 with drinks for 65 euros. The price isn't a compromise for the food though, my Argentinian steak was amazing and cooked just the way I like. Although I state that this is a family restaurant, it is actually for friends too. Anyone who wants to just go for an up-scale casual meal, really. While I was there (on a school night, so understandable) there weren't any families but us, however the place was filled with laughing, happy people enjoying a great value meal.",5.0

In a party of four, we decided to sit outside along with a great many other guests. The idea had been to only have a beer and enjoy the surroundings, which are very pleasant. Tables are arranged in rows, sometimes with a protective shield of sunshades. The setting reminds me of an old railway station in southern England, circa 1920.

We chose from the varied drinks list and were served by a charming young lady who really did make an effort to be friendly. Sadly, the time taken to bring our order was rather long. There is a word concerning the availability of certain dishes in the menu provided. And so it proved to be the case My wife's chosen simple salad was sadly unavailable, so an alternative was chosen. This again was a simple green salad. When served, it was disappointing: the salad has not been adequately washed. It contained a lot of grit. So as not to upset our friends, who had suggested this venue for our evening out, my wife chose not to complain. She should have sent her salad back.

I chose a hot waffle, served with hot cherries, cream and a vanilla ice cream. Delicious. It was served after nearly 30 minutes wait and one reminder to the overworked waitress. Not her fault.

Verdict: a very amenable outdoor setting, friendly service, affordable dishes, but long in being served. But do look out for the way the salads are presented. Too much grit and foreign bod√≠es to be acceptable.",3.0

And a warm welcome was given to my wife and me by the young waitress, who showed us to the table we had reserved. This visit was entirely different. We appreciated the rapid service and the attention paid to our requirements. A very clear menu and wine list made it easy to choose our lunch and we were offered as an appetiser a delicate dish of marinated shrimps, at no cost.
On a sunny day, we were quite surprised to find that not many guests had come to share our choice, and this made the service quick. The chef makes a speciality of quality Mediterranean dishes as well as traditional fare, so there is no shortage of well-prepared dishes.
My choice was the ‚ÄúLamb Duett‚Äù, in a thick sauce, with gratin potatoes and a side-dish of mushrooms and onion. The serving was copious and very tasty. My wife had a salmon and shrimp gratin in a cream sauce topped with cheese. Most attractive!
We spoke afterwards to the owner/chef,  Andrew E. Onuegbu, who tells us he has been running the restaurant for some seven years. We were able to tell him how pleased we were to find the service much improved and he said he recognised how improvements were necessary in serving guests without long delays, a result, he said of choosing to present quality dishes which clearly takes a lot longer than with ‚Äúrapid‚Äù, pre-prepared dishes.

James and the cook is within easy walking distance of our flat and even if not Wilhelmplatz has more than enough parking spaces. We had often passed the restaurant and had promised that we would one day pop in, so this was that one day.
We had booked a table for 20:00 and arrived a little early, but that was no problem we were given the choice of the two free tables (the restaurant isn't very big, in fact it only has 7 tables, not that, that is a bad thing. Immediately the waiter, who also turned out to be James one of the owner partners gave us the menu and we started a conversation (he had gathered on the telephone while taking our reservation that we were British) about the concept and the partnership of the restaurant. He also informed us that his partner, Andreas the cook, also ran cookery courses and would not be cooking that evening as he had a course.
The menu is not large, but well sorted, it points in a South African/Namibian direction, but not only, fish is also well represented and it was good to see that they laid great worth on usage of local produce. There is also an attempt to add some African style food to the menu, but alas that evening the Ostrich ham and salami was off the menu, pity.
We ordered our starters, My partner a curried lemon grass apple fish soup and I a goats cheese cr√©me brul√®e
The wine list was well sorted, but a bit light on South African wines, we ordered a Spanish red, Cal y Cantos a very nice full bodied wine, that we both really enjoyed.
The starters came and I must say that my portion was very large and filling, the Cr√©me brul√®e couldn't have been better, wonderful and tasty, the crust freshly made (we saw the cook doing it), the mushroom ragout was wonderful and tasty, but alas what was called a rosti on the menu was a stodgy heavy potato cake, sorry but if it say rosti then that is what it should be.
My partner didn't like her soup at all, in fact she said it tasted of uncooked curry powder and had little seasoning.

Next came the mains, I had ordered Wildboar cooked in Guinness, this was served with spring vegetables and sp√§tzle, the wildboar ragout was brought to the table in a small three legged pot, very pretty and I suppose it was intended to represent a bit of a boar treck campfire meal.
The theatre didn't bear out the meal. I am a hunter and cook game and in particularly wildboar, this was underseasoned, I had been expecting a nice strong boar taste, no nothing not even a taste of Guinness, pity that the poor boar gave its life for this dish. If I am serving vegetables to a winter dish then they should pass to the dish sugar snap peas do not. Also if serving sp√§tzle then at least home made, I don't need to pay good money for ""Teigware"" out of a packet.

My partner had ordered the mais fed chicken rouladen (olives) stuffed with coriander and pine nuts on a bed of ratatouille and roast estragon potatoes. She said the chicken was very tasty as were the roast potatoes, but alas the ratatouille had been made with tinned tomatoes, I am sure that tinned tomato are ok if used in sauces and stews, but surely not in a ratatouille.

All in all the meal had some good points, but had a lot more not so good ones, I do not know if it was that the ""Cook"" was absent from the Galley, but I do not expect to pay that sort of money for not correctly, nay not seasoned food, such a pity as we wanted to enjoy it but alas it fell well short of other restaurants that we vist in Kiel.",2.0

The atmosphere is what you expect from a tex-mex place. Our waiter was super-friendly, and when I asked if the quinoa patties were vegan, he immediately went on to explain what on the menu was or wasn't or could easily be 'veganised'... I was very impressed. The starters were ready in no time (nachos with salsa and some rather interesting jalapenos chillies filled with peanut butter - hot!), but unfortunately the main course took much longer... a bit too long really (1h30 after our arrival). When it finally arrived, I must say the meat-eaters were very impressed with their kangaroo steak, chicken steak, satay chicken... as for the veggi fajitas... well they were composed of exactly 2 vegetables: baby corn and sweet potatoes (I actually had 2 mini courgette rings, but my husband had none). Since I'm not a big fan of baby corn, I was pretty disappointed. The whole thing tasted nice nevertheless, as the side-dishes (those which the meaty fajitas would also get: i.e. tomatoes, olives, guacamole, refried beans...) were excellent.

This is a very lively place with a pleasant atmosphere.

I assumed (should hace checked of course) that the Seebar would be like a regular Kieler restaurant, with a good selection of interesting dishes. This however is not the case. Food on the menue can most appropriately be described as ""snack"" With burgers, pizzas and the like. If you look for this, you will not be let down.

I visit Kiel quite often on business and it has become a personal tradition to have this local specialty in a different place each time. When I first arrived, the sight was great - a small house in a row of buildings facing the pier. In front of the restaurant a few middle aged locals were seated, sipping wine, smoking pipes and watching the boats go. I immediately felt this would be a good experience.
Inside, a very friendly lady took my order at the counter and told me to seat wherever I wanted. Make no mistake - this is no formal venue, Das Schiffercafe makes you feel right at home. Here you are not a honoured foreign guest - you are family.
My order of labskaus and wheat beer arrived shortly and it was everything I would ask for. No fancy presentation but a decent plating made for a filling portion. After a few refreshing sips of beer I dug in and promptly realised I had discovered the best labskaus in Kiel. I spent the rest of the meal, mixing herring, beetroot, fried eggs, pickled cucumbers and cured beef with beets and contemplating the harbour. The experience was as good as the dish and I felt infatuated with the place.
Do yourself a favour and go there already, if only to grab a cheap herring sandwich for lunch (herrings are own production, matured in barrels).

Walking from Kanalstra√üe & Kastanienallee towards Holtenau Lighthouse, you'll easily find the location on your left hand side. 
The caf√© used to be a ship's supplier and equipment general store for a long time. The pier has been carrying the name of deceased ship's chandler and entrepreneur Hermann Tiessen since 1976.
The store was converted to this awesome location where you are able to sit indoors or outdoors and watch the ships and boats go by. It's a cool caf√© in which you can drink cold and warm beverages (beer incl.) or have the famous Bismarck herring on a roll, muffins or pieces of cake at reasonable prices. On Sundays you also may dance Tango from 4pm to 7 pm - but you need to have some dance proficiency in order to compete with the 'top dogs'.

Their visiting card spells out ‚ÄúGreek Specialities‚Äù- However, this may at first sight lead the visitor to believe it is typical of Greek restaurants, but in fact this is a typical German restaurant catering mainly for German diners, while serving a number of dishes loosely based on Greek cuisine.

Opening at 5 pm to cater for the German ‚ÄúAbendessen‚Äù, many tables are fully taken well before 6 pm, and by 8 pm the guests have mostly left. So if you intend to spend a leisurely evening over your meal, be sure to book your table for 7pm at the earliest.
This is certainly no Taverna, but in the summer months a pleasant terrace provides al-fresco surroundings to complement the rather bland, spacious interior.

If you choose one of the Greek dishes, do try to avoid thhe many lamb dishes served in a bowl with accompanying vegetables. I say ‚Äúserved‚Äù advisedly, because these dishes are without exception a sort of overcooked lamb stew literally drowning in a bed of tomato soup mixed with the vegetables, like aubergine or broad beans. This main course is served after a small side-salad of typical northern European ingredients, already dressed with (perhaps) olive oil and white vinegar, but you do not really have the choice of adding the quantity of dressing you would like because no oil or vinegar is served or available at the table. You take what you are given; no argument!

As in so many German restaurants, there is very little delicacy. Huge quantities (unless you request a senior portion at the same price) and everything seems to need disguising in a glutinous sauce. Flavours disappear entirely as a consequence. Clearly these sticky lamb dishes are cooked well in advance and are left for what must be hours before being served. The white broad beans with my lamb dish were again not freshly prepared. Perhaps the better choice would have been lamb cutlets, but then again we must try to remember that German restaurants are not he best place to order tender lamb dishes. Most local butchers do not even sell lamb. In the supermarkets lamb is always sold frozen, despite the huge availability of animals on the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein. No, Germans in general do not have a liking for lamb.
.
With average prices, Hellas is a pleasant, comfortable, if bland German restaurant, the service is not slow, which is an essential consideration for German diners, who elect to eat extremely quickly by southern European standards. Smaller quantities and a more refined, more authentic cuisine would probably not meet the approval of the average guest at the Hellas.",3.0

A word of warning, finding the restaurant, particularly at night, is something of an adventure in itself. You cannot rely on the somewhat vague map shown on the website as it is just not detailed enough. However, once you have made your way through seemingly endless forests and woods along narrow and somewhat unpaved lanes (roads is definitely NOT the word that suits), you arrive at the restaurant set alone on the north bank of the canal itself. You may not know, but this canal is far from being a rural backwater, typical of many canals in other European countries, but is one of the world‚Äôs major shipping routes, linking the North Sea with the Baltic Sea as it traverses the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein. So expect to witness the passage of some fairly huge sea-going vessels and cruise liners as you look out from your window seat in the restaurant. And in the summer months you can enjoy the same views from the outside terrace, with your toes almost in the water.
We booked our dinner table in advance, something I really recommend, since at weekends this is a popular setting. Menus are displayed on huge well-filled blackboards, carefully arranged in front of the tables by the ever-attentive young proprietor. The choice is enormous. Locally caught fish are matched by more exotic seafood dishes, and complemented by regional cooking and international steaks. As a starter, you should try a small plate of freshly cooked ‚ÄúStint‚Äù, sardine-sized smelt, served in a wonderful sauce (olive oil?), and accompanied by a selection of bread delicately flavoured with herbs. A real treat! I had this as a starter, but the same dish is also served as a main course for those with a larger appetite.
If you are at all concerned about ordering a dish, talk the question through with the proprietor and chef, who assures me that all is possible. A very friendly young professional, who incidentally speaks fluent English and certainly is an expert in his field of cuisine. 
As a main course, try the Coquilles Saint-Jacques (St Jakobsmusscheln) which, although few in number will be more than adequate for anyone with a healthy appetite and a taste for a deliciously prepared dish. A dry Riesling, served by the glass, makes a refreshing alternative to some of the sweeter white wines often preferred by German restaurateurs.
Service in the Kanalfeuer was reasonably rapid. Why is it that many German reviewers complain about slow service? I am led to believe, from personal experience, that eating a meal in Germany is almost a race against the clock. Surely a little more time spent at the table is a pleasure in itself. So why the rush? Particularly when the meal is so delicious.
Highly recommended! We shall return.",4.0

As I boarded, I was shown to my table on the second deck. Linen tablecloth, ceramic china and stainless steel silverware were the order of the day at my classy table overlooking the shipping and boating activity on the Kieler Foerde and North Sea Canal.  The easy to reach Freya, a side paddle steamboat,  is very close to the main train station in Kiel. The captain explained significant points as we headed up the Foerde, waited for a ship to exit the lock at the entrance to the canal and leisurely cruised the approximate 33 kilometers to Rendsburg.  We passed many ships and numerous small craft along the way while enjoying our appetizers and main course of the Brunch Buffet.  The all you can eat spread included many tasty German specialties.   The crew was helpful and value for this journey was excellent.

We didn't get so much as an apology and they didn't make any allowances for the fact that my German isn't particularly good.

It is a wonderful former blacksmith barn/workshop turned into an excellent restaurant serving up classic local dishes with more modern ingredients (e.g., pumpkin) and techniques. Nothing but compliments to the chefs who make it worth a journey to dine here.  Indeed, be warned, the portions are quite substantial, most adults can barely finish the entree, so avoid ordering 3 courses for one individual.  My only complaint is that they do not keep their wine list up to date and their servers do not seem to be aware of the fact that one year's vintage can taste quite dramatically different from another year's vintage.  We ordered a Chianti Ruffino from 2008 (and excellent year for Mediterranean wines) and were almost served a 2011 at the same price.  I refused the bottle and sought out another choice, a Nero d'Avolo.  This time they didn't even bring out the same winery's selection as shown in the wine list and covered up the vintage year with a napkin.  It was drinkable, even quite good.

First we visited the antiques fair laid out in the typical former farmhouse setting on two levels, situated directly beside the restaurant.  Use the same entrance for both! Your car will be safely guarded in off-the-road parking just a few metres from the entrance.

The antiques fair is beautifully presented, with expert help from knowledgeable staff who clearly take pride in their work. Fine old furniture has its place beside more modern, yet still tasteful pieces and you can select some paintings or prints from a maritime collection displayed on the walls. You are never far from a savoury reminder of the restaurant, built in a cosy atmosphere around a central fireplace which is stacked with glowing logs and provides a panoramic source of welcome heat to the nearby tables. The welcome is warm and courteous too.

The tables are well spaced out, leaving room for exemplary service from a discrete team of young women dressed in long dark skirts and the traditional long aprons of the profession. Advice on the selection from the very adequate menu is freely given, and the selection of dishes is very varied, but always of the highest order. My own choice was the fillet of roast lamb from the local dunes that stretch along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where they border the North Sea. It was served with a creamy side-plate of gratin-style potatoes and a flavoursome sauce. A glass of shiraz makes a very adequate choice of wine, cool but not chilled, just as it should be. A dry red wine which is full-bodied and satisfying. You may need to spend some time finding your way round the complete menu, but do ask one of the helpful assistants for guidance. It is never overdone and is given in a friendly and competent way. Top marks for service and for the very high quality of the delicious food.

As always for a restaurant of this exceptional quality, a prior reservation if essential, especially if you prefer a certain table or position near the open fireplace. And do leave time to take a look at the antiques. A visual delight, as is the teashop and local produce shop set in the grounds of the old farmhouse.",5.0

What I received was food that took about half an hour to arrive and reminded me of canteen low quality packed products that were mashed together in order to create something that gave me a distant reminder of a meal. 
I ordered a shrimp risotto, but received extremely creamy and overcooked rice with half finished prawns and shrimps that tasted like some form of egg yolk. I was very disappointed by the food here, because I at least expected the fish to be fresh with respect to the great location directly at the east German sea. 
The seating was comfortable, although windy and the view was fantastic. One could see the boats and ocean from where we sat. 
The service of the restaurant was friendly nonetheless, but it didn't make up for the food and the terrible overpricing because of the restaurant's location. One meal cost around 14 euros and we paid 75 euros for three adults and two children meals.

Our concern leaving Wang-Su is that the locals would equate its fare to be real Chinese food. They almost look like Chinese food but they tasted nothing like what they should be. We marveled that EVERY single stirred fried dish tasted bland and looked the same. How is that even possible!

I had thought that my sister who now eats mostly vegan can enjoy some fresh fruits and veggies. The fruit bar features 3 types of canned fruits, plus banana, honey dew and oranges cut the wrong way. They looked so sad I didn't take any. I took 1 cube from each of the 3 jello flavors, they all have rubber like texture. Really! They can't even make jello right, which is American, all one had to do is add the right amount of water to the powder!

The salad bar looked okay but had too few varieties. But the seaweed was not seasoned and even the kimchi tasted wrong which I have never ever experienced at a restaurant any where. How can anyone screw up kimchi?

The deep fried bar selection looked okay, except that the 3 or 4 different types of sauces which I took care to place separately on my plate all tasted about the same. I have heard of tone deaf people, guess there are also folks whose tongues cannot tell one taste from another, but there's got to be more than one cook in the kitchen!

I should have used only the Mongolian BBQ service, but I don't go to a restaurant so they can just sizzle up my assembled ingredients and sauce. What would be the point in that? I do that at home everyday!

The only saving grace is that it's relatively inexpensive @ ‚Ç¨10/head for all you can eat lunch buffet. But even if you pay me ‚Ç¨10, you can't get me to eat there again.",1.0

Don't worry, this restaurant is definitely not a low budget one. On the other hand, at least with our Scandinavian high- cost background, we found it very reasonably priced. It offers a buffet with a large variety of dishes from different Asian regions:
Sushi, sashimi, dim sum, Chinese wok, Mongolian bbq, fruits, icecream. Something out of the ordinary were frog legs, crocodile meat, Peking duck (cooked to perfection), streuselkuchen and black forest gateau! All fresh and delicate.

They offer 3 different seatings all with a given time slot. If you want to sit by the windows they charge you a bit more. We did that which was nice, we had a great table. The food in itself is over all average at best. Clearly quantity goes over quality. Unlimited wine and beer seems to be an appealing option however. The hot food selection looked quite sloppy so we decided to stick to the cold dishes and they were good. Shrimp, salmon and herring is pretty difficult to go wrong with. The desserts were good. In all a pleasant dinner, but it would have been even better if the time slots had been a bit longer. 1 1/2 hours felt a bit stressed.

The ferry Stena Germanica is just a floating truck - nothing else. The selection of restaurants is lousy and prices are Swedish - extremely high for low quality. Probably the most boring sailing trip one can embark upon. DO NOT GO. In the restaurant we paid 20 EUR per burger - but I must say that a cheap cheeseburger at McDonald's is more value for money. The buffet at the cantine is twice price (350 SEK) against 168 DKK) of Scandlines with more or less same selection of food. What a complete and utterly disgusting tourist trap.,1.0

View from the window over the harbour area and nice set tables. The service is a bit crude, but the waiter knew his business around whines. Some improvement needed though, when a glass of whine is served, one should present the bottle, not just take the glass which has been standing on the serving table. Not many guests, so the swift service should not be a surprise.

Restaurants on a ferry line is obviously a special business, you ""have"" to be here. But there is the choice of the Taste buff√© restaurant, which I have always in the past chosen. Worth the price? Yes, in comparison on the ship but bordeline if comparing with a regular land based place. Choose metropolitan for the more secluded and calm atmosphere compared to Taste and you will not be disappointed.

Fixed 2 or 3 course dinner are offered at discount, although I had expected that the lobster soup for entr√©e could have been changed. Why this inflexibility, any other restaurant would have done it?

September,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187412-d1343700-Reviews-September-Kiel_Schleswig_Holstein.html,Geh√∂rt zu den f√ºhrenden Restaurants in Kiel!,"Zwar wurde das Gourmet-Restaurant im ersten Stock schon vor Jahren geschlossen und es steht regul√§r ""nur noch"" das Bistro im Untergeschoss mit Garten zur Verf√ºgung, aber immerhin seit mehr als 40 Jahren wird hier auf hohem Niveau gekocht.

Nat√ºrlich ist im Fr√ºhjahr der sehr sch√∂n angelegte Garten noch ""naturbelassen"", aber im Sommer herrscht hier eine sehr romantische, fast verwunschene Atmosph√§re. Der sehr pers√∂nliche, freundliche Service des Besitzers ist ein pr√§gendes Element im September. Das Ambiente und die gesamte Atmosph√§re sind besonders und werden nicht jedem Gast gefallen, es sollte sich daher jeder selber ein Bild machen. Ganz klar kein modernes Schickimicki Sternerestaurant, die man z.B. in Hamburg und Berlin kommen und gehen sieht...

Die Speisen waren preislich im oberen Bereich angesiedelt, die optische Pr√§sentation und Qualit√§t allerdings ausgezeichnet. W√§hrend ca. 6.50 ‚Ç¨ f√ºr Martini bzw. Campari Orange durchaus fair sind, ist m.E. 7.50 ‚Ç¨ f√ºr eine Flasche Wasser reichlich √ºberzogen, allerdings findet man dieses Abzocken ist praktisch allen guten Restaurants.

Ein G√§nseparfait f√ºr 12.50 ‚Ç¨ ist dagegen den Preis absolut wert und die hervorragende Lammkeule mit 25.50 ‚Ç¨ noch o.k. Aus der sehr gut sortierten Weinkarte habe ich einen Santa Christina Cabernet Sauvignon gew√§hlt, der ausgezeichnet war, allerdings halte ich den 5 fachen Preis (im Verh√§ltnis zum privaten Kauf) f√ºr stark √ºberzogen. Hier w√§re bei dem Faktor 3 der Schlussstrich zu ziehen und daher vergebe ich keine 5 Sterne.

In Kiel hat man keine gro√üe Wahl, wenn das Niveau sehr hoch sein soll und daher geh√∂rt f√ºr mich seit vielen Jahren das September best√§ndig zum Kreis der ersten Adressen. Es gab mal ein L√ºneburghaus und ein Quam, die in der gleichen Liga spielten, aber die sind Geschichte...

Daher eine absolute Empfehlung f√ºr Freunde von gutem Essen und Trinken mit einer unverwechselbaren Atmosph√§re. Die Umgebung ist wenig reizvoll, aber davon bekommt man ja nichts mit, wenn man drinnen sitzt!",4.0

Alle Speisen werden frisch zubereitet, die Zutaten sind ganz √ºberwiegend regional. Gerade die Pr√§sentation der Vorspeisen war spektakul√§r. Auf jeden Fall sollte man genug Geduld mitbringen, ein Chef de cuisine und ein Chef de service k√ºmmern sich um alles.

Es gibt eine sch√∂ne Terrasse mit vielen K√ºbelpflanzen. Meist sitzt man in einem Wintergarten, ca. 120qm gro√ü.
Die Speisekarte ist √ºberschaubar. Eine Speise war aus ( Zackenbarsch ). Es fallen die hohen Preise auf, f√ºr ein Entrecote, gesch√§tzt 180gr. ‚Ç¨ 26,50 ist heftig. Die Getr√§nke folgen diesem Preisnivau.
Der Service ist d√ºrftig, Unf√§higkeit wird √ºberspielt mit kleinen Comedyeinlagen, unpassend.
Es dauert alles ewig. Die Getr√§nke ca. eine halbe Stunde, die Vorspeisen, ein Tapasteller, der
mit spanischen Tapas so gar nichts zu tun hat, eine weitere halbe Stunde. Der Hauptgang dann noch einmal eine weitere 3/4 Stunde. Der angerichtete Teller, mit einem Klachs So√üe erinnerte mehr an ein Kantinenessen, 2-3 diagonale aufgeschnittenen gr√ºnen und Wei√üen Spargelst√§ngchen, ein kleines und etwas gr√∂√üeres St√ºck Fleisch ohne besonderen Geschmack. Die Rosmarinkartoffel waren praktisch roh und nicht zu essen. Insgesamt die Entt√§uschung. Unseren Freunden ging es nicht anders. Der Preis 207 Euro f√ºr 4 Personen, eine echte Unversch√§mtheit.

Well-cooked basic food served at the comfort of a candle-lit table decorated with fresh flowers, but without any of the pomp associated with many more expensive restaurants. For years, this restaurant close to the marina on the northern bank of the Kiel Canal, where it joins the Kiel Sound near the Baltic coast, has served many of its maritime visitors and would-be sailors with hugely ample portions of steak (cooked to perfection), schnitzel to cover your plate, and a selection of chips (French fries), bratkartoffeln (fried potatoes), and accompanying vegetables such as green beans, onions and pickles. Choose from an extensive menu but please note that portions are always - and without exception - massive. There is a passable dry red house wine, but you will probably enjoy a good glass of the German cool and satisfying beer with your meal. Waiting times vary, but you can wait in comfort at your table, where you will be either left in peace or approached by one of the colourful local characters who pop in for the conversation or a swift beer. The ""patron"" is talkative, but has little English. No matter - you are guaranteed a warm welcome. Finally prices: expect to pay between 20 and 30 Euros per person, inclusive of  a beer or two.
