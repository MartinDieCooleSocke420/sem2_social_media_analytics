       " <p>When she was younger, Hyobin Lee yearned to be a mother. There came a point, however, when she had to make a difficult decision. Ultimately, she chose her career over a family and is now a successful academic in the South Korean city of Daejeon.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Lee, now 44, is just one of millions of Korean women who are making a conscious decision to remain childless — resulting in the nation's fertility rate dropping to a new record low.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The fertility rate — the average number of births per woman — shrank to 0.72 last year, according to preliminary government statistics released on Wednesday, down from 0.78 in the previous year and continuing the gradual annual decline since 2015.</p>,\n",
       " <p>That figure is well below the 2.1 children required to maintain <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/south-korea/t-63357867\">South Korea's</a> population, with the mere 230,000 children born last year hinting that the nation's total population is on course to fall to around 26 million — half the current total — by 2100.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"When I was young, I dreamed of having a son who looked like me,\" Lee told DW. \"I wanted to play with him, to read together and show him much of the world. But I have come to realize that reality is not so simple.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"I chose not to have children because of my career,\" she said. \"Having and raising a child would cause problem for my career and I fear I would resent the child for that reason. And as a consequence, both the child and I would be unhappy.\"</p>,\n",

       " <p>A successful career in Korea's male-dominated society is one reason that many women give for opting to remain childless, but there are many more, Lee points out.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"Economic issues play a significant role and despite various childbirth policies designed to support women, these measures are not functioning as intended,\" she said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Parental leave, for example, is by law available for both men and women, but it is overwhelmingly perceived and utilized by women.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Just 1.3% of Korean men use their parental leave entitlement, compared to an average of 43.4% across the 38 states of the <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/oecd-organization-for-economic-cooperation-and-development/t-17437710\">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</a>(OECD).</p>,\n",
       " <p>This means that Korean companies are reluctant to hire young women as they fear that they will invest in training a new member of staff only for her to leave after she become pregnant and then focus on being a full-time mother rather than returning to the workforce.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"In Korea, there is still a prevalent culture that believes bearing children and all aspects of childcare are solely the responsibility of women,\" Lee added. \"The challenge of simultaneously managing childbirth and childcare is so daunting that many women choose not to have children at all. This can be said for me as well.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p>Jungmin Kwon, an associate professor at Portland State University in Oregon who specializes in East Asian popular culture, agrees that the pressures of South Korean society can be stifling.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"According to many studies, significant factors include the cost and effort involved in childcare,\" she said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"Korea is famous for its extensive private education market and it is difficult to go against an atmosphere in which it is taken for granted that parents will spend a lot of money on various private education programs from a young age in order to compete with other children.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"More importantly, in the current patriarchal culture, where women are expected to bear the majority of the mental and physical energy required to raise children, childbirth and childcare are challenging choices for women,\" Kwon said, pointing out that statistics show that women still do five times more housework and childcare duties than men.</p>,\n",
       " <p class=\"vjs-no-js\">To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href=\"https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/\" target=\"_blank\">supports HTML5 video</a></p>,\n",
       " <p>\"In a situation where respect and consideration for women working across society have not yet taken root, managing both home and career smoothly is a challenging and stressful task for women.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p>And the consequence of that, she points out, is that as gender education levels become more equal and women have more economic resources and choices in their occupation than in the past, they are discovering many ways to live without relying on men.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"Many women do not want to constrain their lives by choosing not only not to have children, but also not to get married,\" Kwon said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Aggressive efforts by recent South Korean governments to boost the birth rate — including additional benefits for families with multiple children and support for single-parent families — have clearly failed to turn the tide, Lee points out, and have had the unanticipated consequence of fueling resentment among men.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"They feel aggrieved that they have to complete mandatory military service and they argue that there is no equivalent obligation for women, yet women benefit from numerous supportive policies,\" she said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>It was this sector of the voting public that in part secured Yoon Suk Yeol's victory in the presidential election of May 2022 after he vowed during the campaign to abolish the <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/south-korea-gender-divide-becomes-key-election-issue/a-60481392\">Ministry of Gender Equality and Family</a>.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Both Lee and Kwon are pessimistic that South Korea's population crisis can be overcome, with Lee saying that young women appear to have no interest in responding to the nation's needs.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"There is a pervasive belief that issues of birth rates and social pressure are not their concern,\" she said. \"The younger generation's prevalent individualism means that social pressures are unlikely to aid in improving birth rates.\"</p>,\n",
       " <p>Kwon echoes that assessment.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"Young women today have dissimilar perspectives about family, marriage, childbirth, community and the nation-state from previous generations.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"They are less entrapped by the ‘obligations of being a woman' imposed by patriarchal states, societies and households,\" she said.</p>,\n",
       " <p>\"Currently it is not feasible for patriarchal structures to change overnight and, accordingly, it's also pessimistic to think that women will have children to increase Korea's birth rate.\"</p>,\n",

To help reduce stifling temperatures, some cities are creating more green spaces. But individuals can help too by unsealing their gardens.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>It's a summer night. After a sweltering day, temperatures have barely dropped. <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/heat-and-drought/t-19024671\">Heat</a> radiates from the pavement. Sleeping is difficult because it's too warm. But just 15 kilometers away in the leafy countryside, everyone is sleeping soundly.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Urban areas can be up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit (3.9 Celsius) warmer than nearby countryside, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. That's because of the <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/solutions-climate-change-global-warming-permafrost-locusts-sea-level-extreme-weather-heat/a-57071503\">\"urban heat island effect.\"</a></p>,\n",
       "   <p>The phenomenon is down to the ways cities are built. Glass, steel and concrete buildings and paved-over ground surfaces trap heat and radiate it back into the air. The result is tropical nights.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Heat can be dangerous. One study in scientific journal Nature found more than 60,000 people died in Europe from heat-related illnesses in summer 2022. The IPCC, the UN's climate science institution, said deadly <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/report-extreme-weather-could-kill-over-150000-europeans-per-year-by-2100/a-39974926\">heat could affect more than half of the global population by 2100</a>. Cities, which are home to 56% of the world's population and rising, will be exposed to much greater heat compared to rural areas.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Some cities like <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/what-are-sponge-cities-and-how-do-they-work/a-68407366\">Copenhagen in Denmark are tackling heat island effects</a> by rolling back impermeable surfaces and creating green spaces. But individuals are also trying to do their bit by greening their sealed over gardens and driveways. </p>,\n",
       "   <p>\"You can use a garden hoe or a shovel to get started,\" Fatma Özkan told DW. She works at a consumer advice agency in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and helps to guide people through the unsealing process.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Özkan unsealed her driveway a few years ago because she wanted a more environmentally friendly property. Over the course of a few days, she removed the pavement, replacing it mainly with grass.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>\"If you are dealing with a bound surface like concrete or asphalt, you usually need a better tool such as a drill,\" explained Özkan, adding that it's best to consult professionals if you want to unseal such a surface.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Unbound surfaces like sand, wood chippings or paving stones without concrete or cement mortars, can be ripped out more easily.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Rainwater flows on impermeable surfaces like asphalt and can't seep into the soil. Excess water drains into the sewage system but when heavy rain hits, sewers can become overwhelmed and cause severe <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/floods-in-germany/t-58300604\">flooding</a>. In some cases, people <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/extreme-weather/t-19020379\">can lose their homes, belongings or their lives.</a></p>,\n",
       "   <p>Unsealing surfaces allows soil to store water that can then be used by plants in drier periods. Replacing concrete and sealed surfaces with grass and vegetation also creates \"natural air-conditioning,\" said landscape architect Wolfgang Heidenreich. That's because some of the stored water evaporates when it gets hot, cooling the surrounding area.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>\"It is like stepping out of the shower. Once the water evaporates, it gets cold on your skin,\" said Heidenreich, who works for Green City, a German environmental organization offering advice on creating eco-friendly urban environments.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>It's crucial to pick a surface that lets water seep through in the space you've unsealed. Stone gardens are trendy but \"they don't make any sense. They tend to retain heat,\" said Heidenreich, who is based in southern Germany. Unlike soil they cannot store water.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Heidenreich advocates for the use of drought-resistant grass and herbs which are suitable for cold winters and hot summers.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>\"You should check which seeds grow well in your region, so they are fit to survive in the regional climate,\" Heidenreich added. This also helps vital pollinators like <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/bees-and-humans-need-each-other/a-17391639\">wild bees</a> flourish and promotes <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"/en/biodiversity/t-50781411\">biodiversity</a>.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>For those looking to unseal a driveway or garden without losing space to walk or park their car, Fatma Özkan suggests opting for \"wood chips, wooden grates, or grass pavers with open stones in the middle.\"</p>,\n",
       "   <p>In her own driveway, Özkan chose a few stones that provide a good amount of space in between for grass to grow. This way, water can seep into the ground, but she can still drive up to her house.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>Flat roofs, especially gravel-covered ones on garages, for instance, can be unsealed as well.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>\"You just remove the gravel and open up the possibility to plant herbs on your roof,\" Heidenreich said.</p>,\n",
       "   <p>To help the herbs grow you can use a \"roof garden substrate,\" which is\" a special soil mix to support plant growth.\"</p>,\n",
       "   <p>People don't need to wait for governments to start big unsealing projects \"everyone can start with their own property,\" Heidenreich said.</p>,\n",
