       " 'main_text': ['New statistics show a record low number of children were born last year in South Korea, with women citing a desire for a career and to push back against a male-dominated society as key reasons.',\n",
       "  'When she was younger, Hyobin Lee yearned to be a mother. There came a point, however, when she had to make a difficult decision. Ultimately, she chose her career over a family and is now a successful academic in the South Korean city of Daejeon.',\n",
       "  \"Lee, now 44, is just one of millions of Korean women who are making a conscious decision to remain childless ‚Äî resulting in the nation's fertility rate dropping to a new record low.\",\n",
       "  'The fertility rate ‚Äî the average number of births per woman ‚Äî shrank to 0.72 last year, according to preliminary government statistics released on Wednesday, down from 0.78 in the previous year and continuing the gradual annual decline since 2015.',\n",
       "  \"That figure is well below the 2.1 children required to maintain South Korea's population, with the mere 230,000 children born last year hinting that the nation's total population is on course to fall to around 26 million ‚Äî half the current total ‚Äî by 2100.\",\n",
       "  '\"When I was young, I dreamed of having a son who looked like me,\" Lee told DW. \"I wanted to play with him, to read together and show him much of the world. But I have come to realize that reality is not so simple.\"',\n",
       "  '\"I chose not to have children because of my career,\" she said. \"Having and raising a child would cause problem for my career and I fear I would resent the child for that reason. And as a consequence, both the child and I would be unhappy.\"',\n",
       "  \"A successful career in Korea's male-dominated society is one reason that many women give for opting to remain childless, but there are many more, Lee points out.\",\n",
       "  '\"Economic issues play a significant role and despite various childbirth policies designed to support women, these measures are not functioning as intended,\" she said.',\n",
       "  'Parental leave, for example, is by law available for both men and women, but it is overwhelmingly perceived and utilized by women.',\n",
       "  'Just 1.3% of Korean men use their parental leave entitlement, compared to an average of 43.4% across the 38 states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD).',\n",
       "  'This means that Korean companies are reluctant to hire young women as they fear that they will invest in training a new member of staff only for her to leave after she become pregnant and then focus on being a full-time mother rather than returning to the workforce.',\n",
       "  '\"In Korea, there is still a prevalent culture that believes bearing children and all aspects of childcare are solely the responsibility of women,\" Lee added. \"The challenge of simultaneously managing childbirth and childcare is so daunting that many women choose not to have children at all. This can be said for me as well.\"',\n",
       "  'Jungmin Kwon, an associate professor at Portland State University in Oregon who specializes in East Asian popular culture, agrees that the pressures of South Korean society can be stifling.',\n",
       "  '\"According to many studies, significant factors include the cost and effort involved in childcare,\" she said.',\n",
       "  '\"Korea is famous for its extensive private education market and it is difficult to go against an atmosphere in which it is taken for granted that parents will spend a lot of money on various private education programs from a young age in order to compete with other children.\"',\n",
       "  '\"More importantly, in the current patriarchal culture, where women are expected to bear the majority of the mental and physical energy required to raise children, childbirth and childcare are challenging choices for women,\" Kwon said, pointing out that statistics show that women still do five times more housework and childcare duties than men.',\n",
       "  '\"In a situation where respect and consideration for women working across society have not yet taken root, managing both home and career smoothly is a challenging and stressful task for women.\"',\n",
       "  'And the consequence of that, she points out, is that as gender education levels become more equal and women have more economic resources and choices in their occupation than in the past, they are discovering many ways to live without relying on men.',\n",
       "  '\"Many women do not want to constrain their lives by choosing not only not to have children, but also not to get married,\" Kwon said.',\n",
       "  'Aggressive efforts by recent South Korean governments to boost the birth rate ‚Äî including additional benefits for families with multiple children and support for single-parent families ‚Äî have clearly failed to turn the tide, Lee points out, and have had the unanticipated consequence of fueling resentment among men.',\n",
       "  '\"They feel aggrieved that they have to complete mandatory military service and they argue that there is no equivalent obligation for women, yet women benefit from numerous supportive policies,\" she said.',\n",
       "  \"It was this sector of the voting public that in part secured Yoon Suk Yeol's victory in the presidential election of May 2022 after he vowed during the campaign to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family.\",\n",
       "  \"Both Lee and Kwon are pessimistic that South Korea's population crisis can be overcome, with Lee saying that young women appear to have no interest in responding to the nation's needs.\",\n",
       "  '\"There is a pervasive belief that issues of birth rates and social pressure are not their concern,\" she said. \"The younger generation\\'s prevalent individualism means that social pressures are unlikely to aid in improving birth rates.\"',\n",
       "  'Kwon echoes that assessment.',\n",
       "  '\"Young women today have dissimilar perspectives about family, marriage, childbirth, community and the nation-state from previous generations.',\n",
       "  '\"They are less entrapped by the ‚Äòobligations of being a woman\\' imposed by patriarchal states, societies and households,\" she said.',\n",
       "  '\"Currently it is not feasible for patriarchal structures to change overnight and, accordingly, it\\'s also pessimistic to think that women will have children to increase Korea\\'s birth rate.\"',\n",

The stock market breathed a sigh of relief in response, with insiders pointing to areas where Apple should redouble its efforts instead.', 'Traditional car manufacturers in Europe, Asia and the US face a number of problems, some of them of their own making. To make matters worse,\\xa0the creeping concern that tech companies could crowd legacy firms out of the personal mobility market looms over manufacturers like the figurative sword of Damocles. This threat materialized when Google parent Alphabet and Apple announced their self-driving car endeavors, Waymo and Project Titan.', 'Traditional car manufacturers worried they would be reduced to hardware delivery services, providing motorized base frames for \"smartphones on wheels.\" As of this week, however, these fears might be a thing of the past, with\\xa0Apple announcing that it was canceling its Titan\\xa0electric vehicle project.', 'Instead, New York-based business daily The Wall Street Journal reported\\xa0that some of the 2,000 car-developing staff members would shift to working on artificial intelligence (AI). That move could affect several hundred hardware developers, according to the US media group Bloomberg.', 'The AI field, specifically using programs such as ChatGPT to create new content from ever-growing mounds of data, is considered far more promising.\\xa0Despite this, layoffs are to be expected.', \"Many insiders had been generally reserved about Apple's efforts to enter the auto industry, arguing that its business model was entirely different than that of the tech industry.\\xa0\", \"They pointed out that electronic components for car manufacturing could not simply be sent by\\xa0mail, or digitally uploaded to customers' computers. Instead, the business required shipping large and heavy parts across the globe, and maintaining them regularly.\", 'Insiders also contended that, not least due to the many regulations in the industry, the development cycles for automotive products lasts\\xa0much longer ‚Äî not weeks and months, but years.', \"Finally, the profit margins in the automotive sector are much lower than in Apple's tech business. From the very beginning, car manufacturers had cautioned that building and selling a car was not easy.\", 'In the past few years, there was speculation\\xa0that Apple might wind down its own development efforts simply by buying up a large component supplier or car manufacturer. The potential involvement of British luxury car builder McLaren was\\xa0the subject of much debate.', \"Elon Musk, the\\xa0founder of the US-based automotive and clean energy company Tesla, said he once offered to sell his car manufacturing business to Apple amid\\xa0production challenges hounding Tesla's\\xa0Model 3 line. But, as Musk recounted, Apple CEO Tim Cook wasn't even interesting in talking.\", 'Project Titan\\xa0cost Apple over $10 billion (‚Ç¨9.3 billion), according to a\\xa0report this week\\xa0in The New York Times. Bloomberg estimated that the car development costs broke down to $1 billion each year.', \"Other market observers, such as analysts at the US consulting firm Guidehouse, believe Apple invested between $15 billion and $20 billion in development. That's money that will now be freed up for other projects, including in the car sector.\", 'In a report on Apple\\'s exit from the autonomous vehicle race, Wall Street analyst Erik Woodring wrote that \"Apple is exhibiting some welcome cost discipline on longer-tailed future projects.\" He suggested that AI might be one of these endeavors.', 'Speaking to Apple\\'s work on electric vehicles (EV) and autonomous vehicles (AV), he added that \"Apple\\'s EV/AV efforts were too far behind well-funded competitors to represent a viable path towards commercialization and product differentiation.\"', \"The stock market responded to the announcement with a fair bit of relief, even if the cancellation did not lead to a jump in the share price. But a small uptick in the company's stocks after the decision was announced indicated that investors were glad to see Apple put its expensive car project\\xa0in the rearview mirror.\", \"Most investors agree that Apple's cancellation of Project Titan was the next logical step. Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer\\xa0of the US-based Franklin Equity Group,\\xa0told the German business newspaper Handelsblatt he believed it was the right choice for Apple to get involved in the automotive industry.\", 'Citing the well-worn adage that cars are essentially \"computers on wheels\" nowadays, he added that his trust had invested billions in Apple.

Very few had actually visited the territory they were carving up, but they wanted to avoid other colonial powers from forming continuous, land axes going in East-West or North-South directions.\\xa0\", \"After the 1884 Berlin Conference, German South West Africa was isolated from German East Africa. Separating them were the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland (Botswana today), northern and Southern Rhodesia (today's Zambia and Zimbabwe). So, in 1890 German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi negotiated with Britain for a strip of land that would allow German access through South West Africa to the Zambezi River, which Germany knew mouthed in East Africa.\\xa0\", 'For this potential trade route, Germany agreed to recognize British influence over Zanzibar and Pemba, just off the coast of German East Africa, and Germany would get the tiny naval base of Heligoland in the North Sea off the German coast. This became known as the 1890 Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany.\\xa0', 'Germany now had the fourth largest colonial empire.

Namibia, or South West Africa, became a mandate of South Africa, with a view of becoming independent down the line. But this did not happened - at least until 1990. Instead, South Africa introduced its apartheid policies, and made the Caprivi rulers a puppet regime.\\xa0', \"And from the 1960s, the Caprivi Strip's strategic geopolitical location meant it was hotbed of war and incursions between South African military forces and liberation fighters launching cross border raids related to the\\xa0Angola Civil War, the Border War and the Rhodesian Bush War.\\xa0\", \"That's three\\xa0separate conflicts which had very little to do with the people living there, and everything to do with foreign powers trying to assert dominance over the region. The guns only fell silent in the late 1990s, after a brief attempt by local Caprivians to secede from the newly independent Namibia failed in 1999.\\xa0\", \"In Cameroon, the Bakassi conflict erupted in the 2000s between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula. Here, Nigerian nationals had lived for generations on land claimed by Cameroon based on colonial era agreements. Sporadic clashes still occur, despite an International Court of Justice ruling in Cameroon's favor.\\xa0\\xa0\", 'Togo, which borders modern day Ghana, was also divided between France and Britain in 1919, along an artificial border. This was rejected by the local Ewe people, who now found themselves in two separate countries. \"British Togoland\" or Western Togoland was then incorporated into Ghana in 1956 after a vote. However, the Ewe majority regions actually voted to remain under a United Nations mandate. To this day, some Ewe groups demand a separate homeland, and the Ghanaian government has increased pressure on activists through arrests and military presence in the region.\\xa0\\xa0', \"And in Tanzania, thanks to the 1890 Heligoland Zanzibar Treaty, the very same deal that created the Caprivi Strip there is a long running dispute with Malawi over who controls Lake Malawi or Lake Nyasa, as Tanzanians call it, there is a dispute over where the border lies. Very basically, according to the Treaty, the border runs along the Tanzanian shore. Tanzania argues that boundary should be in line with numerous other borders and agreements regarding lakes and run through the middle.

Very few had actually visited the territory they were carving up, but they wanted to avoid other colonial powers from forming continuous, land axes going in East-West or North-South directions.\\xa0\", \"After the 1884 Berlin Conference, German South West Africa was isolated from German East Africa. Separating them were the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland (Botswana today), northern and Southern Rhodesia (today's Zambia and Zimbabwe). So, in 1890 German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi negotiated with Britain for a strip of land that would allow German access through South West Africa to the Zambezi River, which Germany knew mouthed in East Africa.\\xa0\", 'For this potential trade route, Germany agreed to recognize British influence over Zanzibar and Pemba, just off the coast of German East Africa, and Germany would get the tiny naval base of Heligoland in the North Sea off the German coast. This became known as the 1890 Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany.\\xa0', 'Germany now had the fourth largest colonial empire. But just 40 kilometers east of where the Caprivi Strip ended, the mighty Mosi-oa-Tunya, or Victoria Falls, rose.', 'This magnificent natural wonder rendered the Zambezi unnavigable, and the German plan was scuppered.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Multiple ethnic groups, who spoke over a dozen languages, suddenly found themselves in 4 different colonial territories.', 'While the Caprivi Strip remained relatively peaceful during colonialism, mainly because Germany had limited interest in the area, this would change when Germany lost its colonies at the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Namibia, or South West Africa, became a mandate of South Africa, with a view of becoming independent down the line. But this did not happened - at least until 1990. Instead, South Africa introduced its apartheid policies, and made the Caprivi rulers a puppet regime.\\xa0', \"And from the 1960s, the Caprivi Strip's strategic geopolitical location meant it was hotbed of war and incursions between South African military forces and liberation fighters launching cross border raids related to the\\xa0Angola Civil War, the Border War and the Rhodesian Bush War.\\xa0\", \"That's three\\xa0separate conflicts which had very little to do with the people living there, and everything to do with foreign powers trying to assert dominance over the region. The guns only fell silent in the late 1990s, after a brief attempt by local Caprivians to secede from the newly independent Namibia failed in 1999.\\xa0\", \"In Cameroon, the Bakassi conflict erupted in the 2000s between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula. Here, Nigerian nationals had lived for generations on land claimed by Cameroon based on colonial era agreements. Sporadic clashes still occur, despite an International Court of Justice ruling in Cameroon's favor.\\xa0\\xa0\", 'Togo, which borders modern day Ghana, was also divided between France and Britain in 1919, along an artificial border. This was rejected by the local Ewe people, who now found themselves in two separate countries. \"British Togoland\" or Western Togoland was then incorporated into Ghana in 1956 after a vote. However, the Ewe majority regions actually voted to remain under a United Nations mandate. To this day, some Ewe groups demand a separate homeland, and the Ghanaian government has increased pressure on activists through arrests and military presence in the region.\\xa0\\xa0', \"And in Tanzania, thanks to the 1890 Heligoland Zanzibar Treaty, the very same deal that created the Caprivi Strip there is a long running dispute with Malawi over who controls Lake Malawi or Lake Nyasa, as Tanzanians call it, there is a dispute over where the border lies. Very basically, according to the Treaty, the border runs along the Tanzanian shore. Tanzania argues that boundary should be in line with numerous other borders and agreements regarding lakes and run through the middle. These are two irreconcilable positions lay dormant, until 2011, when\\xa0Malawi allowed oil exploration in Tanzania's claimed area of the lake.\\n\\nShadows of German Colonialism is produced by DW, Germany's international broadcaster with funding from Germany Federal Foreign Office (AA).

To this day, it hasn't been recognized by any country in the world.\", 'The extremely bloody hostilities in spring 1992 lasted only a few months. But Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria ever since, despite the fact the Kremlin signed an agreement pledging to withdraw them 25 years ago.', 'Outwardly, Transnistria is like a gigantic Soviet outdoor museum, with monuments to Lenin, red flags and hammer-and-sickle symbols galore.', \"Behind all this Soviet memorabilia, however, this sliver of land could more accurately be described as the extensive premises of a company and a military depot run by a small group of former KGB officers who are probably also working for the GRU, Russia's military intelligence service.\", 'Under the guise of Sheriff, a huge holding company, they run money laundering and smuggling operations and practically control all economic activity in the region.', \"Whenever these operations are threatened, the region's powerless parliament, the Supreme Council of Transnistria, or other forums come together and ask Moscow for help, protection or accession to the Russian Federation.\", 'And every time this happens, the threat of a hot war in an otherwise frozen conflict increases.', 'Most recently, on Wednesday, a \"congress of deputies of all levels\" convened in Tiraspol, Transnistria\\'s nominal capital, and passed a resolution to ask Russia for protection in the face of \"increasing pressure\" and the \"economic war\" unleashed by Moldova.', 'Vadim Krasnoselsky, the \"president\" of Transnistria and Sheriff\\'s former head of security, accused the authorities in Chisinau of \"genocide\" against the people of Transnistria.', \"What made Tiraspol's appeal to Moscow so explosive was its timing, just a day before Russian President Vladimir Putin made his annual address to the nation.\", 'There was widespread speculation as to whether Putin would use the appeal as a pretext for announcing some kind of military intervention in Moldova or the annexation of the republic. But Putin made no mention whatsoever of\\xa0Moldova in his address on Thursday.', 'Ahead of Putin\\'s address, Moldovan politicians and media alike spoke of a \"feint\" and a \"propaganda bluff\" on the part of Transnistria that should not be taken seriously.', 'But what led up to the appeal this time around? Since January 1, companies in Transnistria have had to pay customs duties when exporting goods to Moldova proper. It is part of a catalog\\xa0of measures the government in Chisinau is applying in an attempt to gain more control over Transnistria.', 'Sandwiched between Ukraine and Moldova, Transnistria has been an uncontrolled hub for illegal trade, smuggling and money laundering for the past 30 years.', \"Moldova's pro-Western head of state, Maia Sandu, who was a civil rights, anti-corruption activist before being elected president, has made every effort since coming to power in 2020 to stop illegal economic dealings with Transnistria.\", \"Paradoxically, Russia's war against Ukraine helped her in this undertaking. After Russia's full-scale\\xa0invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian authorities closed the country's border with Transnistria to prevent any acts of sabotage or attacks by Russian soldiers on the port city of Odesa and the surrounding region, which is only 70 kilometers (43,5 miles) from Transnistria.\", \"As a result, Transnistria's role as a hub for smuggling and money laundering has diminished drastically.\", 'Oleg Serebrian, Moldova\\'s deputy prime minister and minister for the reintegration of Transnistria, said after Putin\\'s address that he was optimistic that Russia\\'s grip on the separatist region was slipping. In Tiraspol, he said, there were \"several centers of power and, therefore, signs of weakness and a collapse.\"', 'Serebrian\\xa0described Transnistria\\'s appeal to Russia for protection as an \"operation designed to paper over the problems of the separatist regime.\"', '\"Things are going badly both economically and socially in Transnistria,\" he said, \"and the people there need an explanation. The one they are given is that Chisinau and the new customs duties are the mother of all evils and that this is why things are going badly in the region. The reality is, however, that things have been going badly in Transnistria for a long time.\"', \"The fact is that for want of direct access to Moldova, Russia has practically no way of attacking the country. That said, Moscow has between 1,500 and 2,000 soldiers in the country in addition to Transnistria's own armed forces. Together, they are probably much stronger than Moldova's small, very badly equipped 5,000-strong army.\", \"What's more, near the village of Cobasna in northern Transnistria is Europe's largest ammunition depot, which houses about 20,000 tons of Soviet-era ammunition and equipment. Should Russia succeed in advancing into the Odesa region, it could herald the start of an invasion of Moldova.\", 'From a political perspective, Moldova is just as lost to Russia as Ukraine. Last December, the EU decided to open accession negotiations with Moldova.

To make matters worse,\\xa0the creeping concern that tech companies could crowd legacy firms out of the personal mobility market looms over manufacturers like the figurative sword of Damocles. This threat materialized when Google parent Alphabet and Apple announced their self-driving car endeavors, Waymo and Project Titan.', 'Traditional car manufacturers worried they would be reduced to hardware delivery services, providing motorized base frames for \"smartphones on wheels.\" As of this week, however, these fears might be a thing of the past, with\\xa0Apple announcing that it was canceling its Titan\\xa0electric vehicle project.', 'Instead, New York-based business daily The Wall Street Journal reported\\xa0that some of the 2,000 car-developing staff members would shift to working on artificial intelligence (AI). That move could affect several hundred hardware developers, according to the US media group Bloomberg.', 'The AI field, specifically using programs such as ChatGPT to create new content from ever-growing mounds of data, is considered far more promising.\\xa0Despite this, layoffs are to be expected.', \"Many insiders had been generally reserved about Apple's efforts to enter the auto industry, arguing that its business model was entirely different than that of the tech industry.\\xa0\", \"They pointed out that electronic components for car manufacturing could not simply be sent by\\xa0mail, or digitally uploaded to customers' computers. Instead, the business required shipping large and heavy parts across the globe, and maintaining them regularly.\", 'Insiders also contended that, not least due to the many regulations in the industry, the development cycles for automotive products lasts\\xa0much longer ‚Äî not weeks and months, but years.', \"Finally, the profit margins in the automotive sector are much lower than in Apple's tech business. From the very beginning, car manufacturers had cautioned that building and selling a car was not easy.\", 'In the past few years, there was speculation\\xa0that Apple might wind down its own development efforts simply by buying up a large component supplier or car manufacturer. The potential involvement of British luxury car builder McLaren was\\xa0the subject of much debate.', \"Elon Musk, the\\xa0founder of the US-based automotive and clean energy company Tesla, said he once offered to sell his car manufacturing business to Apple amid\\xa0production challenges hounding Tesla's\\xa0Model 3 line. But, as Musk recounted, Apple CEO Tim Cook wasn't even interesting in talking.\", 'Project Titan\\xa0cost Apple over $10 billion (‚Ç¨9.3 billion), according to a\\xa0report this week\\xa0in The New York Times. Bloomberg estimated that the car development costs broke down to $1 billion each year.', \"Other market observers, such as analysts at the US consulting firm Guidehouse, believe Apple invested between $15 billion and $20 billion in development. That's money that will now be freed up for other projects, including in the car sector.\", 'In a report on Apple\\'s exit from the autonomous vehicle race, Wall Street analyst Erik Woodring wrote that \"Apple is exhibiting some welcome cost discipline on longer-tailed future projects.\" He suggested that AI might be one of these endeavors.', 'Speaking to Apple\\'s work on electric vehicles (EV) and autonomous vehicles (AV), he added that \"Apple\\'s EV/AV efforts were too far behind well-funded competitors to represent a viable path towards commercialization and product differentiation.\"', \"The stock market responded to the announcement with a fair bit of relief, even if the cancellation did not lead to a jump in the share price. But a small uptick in the company's stocks after the decision was announced indicated that investors were glad to see Apple put its expensive car project\\xa0in the rearview mirror.\", \"Most investors agree that Apple's cancellation of Project Titan was the next logical step. Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer\\xa0of the US-based Franklin Equity Group,\\xa0told the German business newspaper Handelsblatt he believed it was the right choice for Apple to get involved in the automotive industry.\", 'Citing the well-worn adage that cars are essentially \"computers on wheels\" nowadays, he added that his trust had invested billions in Apple. Curtis also told the German paper that he thought Apple\\'s cancellation of its Project Titan was also \"a good decision.\"', 'Now, Curtis argued, Apple would have to focus on ensuring that the AI on its phones ran smoothly. He pointed to one of Apple\\'s uncharacteristic failures, asking: \"What is one of the worst products that Apple\\'s released in the last 10 years?\"', 'The answer, he said, was Siri, Apple\\'s virtual voice assistant. \"If Apple can fix Siri,\" he argued, \"they could launched a massive new iPhone cycle.\" Then the tech giant could sell new services that offered real added value in association with Siri software, Curtis said.', 'At a digital shareholder\\'s meeting last week, Apple executive Cook announced that his company had new AI features in store. Traditionally, such promises to \"break new ground\" are saved for Apple\\'s annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June.\\xa0', 'This article was originally written in German.'], 'related_topics': ['Electric vehicles', 'Apple', 'Artificial intelligence']}, {'author': 'Author not found', 'date': '03/01/2024', 'title': 'Iran elections: Low turnout in parliamentary vote ‚Äì DW ‚Äì 03/01/2024', 'summary': \"Iran's parliamentary elections saw low voter turnout as candidates competed for a seat in the 290-member parliament.

Very few had actually visited the territory they were carving up, but they wanted to avoid other colonial powers from forming continuous, land axes going in East-West or North-South directions.\\xa0\", \"After the 1884 Berlin Conference, German South West Africa was isolated from German East Africa. Separating them were the British Protectorates of Bechuanaland (Botswana today), northern and Southern Rhodesia (today's Zambia and Zimbabwe). So, in 1890 German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi negotiated with Britain for a strip of land that would allow German access through South West Africa to the Zambezi River, which Germany knew mouthed in East Africa.\\xa0\", 'For this potential trade route, Germany agreed to recognize British influence over Zanzibar and Pemba, just off the coast of German East Africa, and Germany would get the tiny naval base of Heligoland in the North Sea off the German coast. This became known as the 1890 Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty between Britain and Germany.\\xa0', 'Germany now had the fourth largest colonial empire. But just 40 kilometers east of where the Caprivi Strip ended, the mighty Mosi-oa-Tunya, or Victoria Falls, rose.', 'This magnificent natural wonder rendered the Zambezi unnavigable, and the German plan was scuppered.\\xa0\\xa0', 'Multiple ethnic groups, who spoke over a dozen languages, suddenly found themselves in 4 different colonial territories.', 'While the Caprivi Strip remained relatively peaceful during colonialism, mainly because Germany had limited interest in the area, this would change when Germany lost its colonies at the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Namibia, or South West Africa, became a mandate of South Africa, with a view of becoming independent down the line. But this did not happened - at least until 1990. Instead, South Africa introduced its apartheid policies, and made the Caprivi rulers a puppet regime.\\xa0', \"And from the 1960s, the Caprivi Strip's strategic geopolitical location meant it was hotbed of war and incursions between South African military forces and liberation fighters launching cross border raids related to the\\xa0Angola Civil War, the Border War and the Rhodesian Bush War.\\xa0\", \"That's three\\xa0separate conflicts which had very little to do with the people living there, and everything to do with foreign powers trying to assert dominance over the region. The guns only fell silent in the late 1990s, after a brief attempt by local Caprivians to secede from the newly independent Namibia failed in 1999.\\xa0\", \"In Cameroon, the Bakassi conflict erupted in the 2000s between Nigeria and Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula. Here, Nigerian nationals had lived for generations on land claimed by Cameroon based on colonial era agreements. Sporadic clashes still occur, despite an International Court of Justice ruling in Cameroon's favor.\\xa0\\xa0\", 'Togo, which borders modern day Ghana, was also divided between France and Britain in 1919, along an artificial border. This was rejected by the local Ewe people, who now found themselves in two separate countries. \"British Togoland\" or Western Togoland was then incorporated into Ghana in 1956 after a vote. However, the Ewe majority regions actually voted to remain under a United Nations mandate. To this day, some Ewe groups demand a separate homeland, and the Ghanaian government has increased pressure on activists through arrests and military presence in the region.\\xa0\\xa0', \"And in Tanzania, thanks to the 1890 Heligoland Zanzibar Treaty, the very same deal that created the Caprivi Strip there is a long running dispute with Malawi over who controls Lake Malawi or Lake Nyasa, as Tanzanians call it, there is a dispute over where the border lies. Very basically, according to the Treaty, the border runs along the Tanzanian shore. Tanzania argues that boundary should be in line with numerous other borders and agreements regarding lakes and run through the middle.

The idea is to use the ability of trees, shrubs and soil to retain water naturally\\xa0and let it flow to places where it is not destructive.\\xa0\", 'A dozen ponds bordering the roundabout are designed to retain excess rainwater in the event of a cloudburst. Like other similar ponds around the city and wide openings on the sides of low-lying streets, they serve to funnel floodwater into a network of tunnels being laid 20 meters (about 65 feet) below the surface.', 'During a \"normal\" downpour, rainwater is directed through this drainage system to the harbor. But when there is an excess like in a cloudburst scenario, a pumping station at the harbor will kick into action, forcing the water collecting in the tunnels out to sea, thereby creating space for more rainwater and preventing the streets from flooding. This is currently under construction and will be ready by 2026.\\xa0', '\"There will still be water in the streets. I mean, it\\'s not going to be completely dry.

Unique in its approach, the exhibition explores how horror has inspired creators in all artistic fields, from fine art to fashion, and from music to film.', 'The exhibition begins with a historical prologue that looks into how the arts and culture have been shaped by horror for centuries, from the fantastic demons of the Renaissance to the dark shadows in Romantic\\xa0landscape paintings\\xa0to various iconic characters from the early horror films of the 20th century, such as \"Nosferatu.\"', 'Throughout history, major artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow and Francisco de Goya have also dealt with horror and dark dreams in their works.', '\"Above all, my hope is that many visitors will then be able to interpret today\\'s manifestations of horror differently, and perhaps have more respect for them,\" said Page.\\n', \"Images of skulls and skeletons widely circulated in European art during the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, especially in times of crisis, such as\\xa0during the Black Death, the\\xa0plague pandemic that struck Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s, or the Thirty Years' War, from\\xa01618 to 1648.\", 'The exhibition notes that the\\xa0macabre motifs served as\\xa0reminders that life is fleeting, but also that \"eternal damnation\" should be seen as a real threat.', 'Different depictions of evil\\xa0created in the 19th century still\\xa0characterize representations of horror to this day. Progressively, the idea of death was romanticized and glorified, which is why the devil came to be portrayed as as a charismatic Satan with an intriguing intellect and a muscular human body.', 'Through 120 exhibits ‚Äî paintings, illustrations and installations from various art forms from the past two centuries ‚Äî \"Death and the Devil.

The theme is chosen years in advance ‚Äî just like the national committee preparing the service.\", 'The current conflict, however, adds urgency to its message.

Is it our literal neighbor? Is it the Israelis? Is it the Jews? Is it the Muslims? So all these questions arose when talking about bearing one another in love,\" said Azer.', 'But there was also a deeper meaning for some, as \"bearing\" in Arabic relates to the term of being pregnant. \"They all associated it with that they carry not only the whole generation,\" said Azar. \"And it\\'s their responsibility to protect their children, although they don\\'t feel like they can do that.\"', 'The Palestinian communities have been working on the liturgy and prayers for the past two years and submitted their contributions last year. Then came the October 7 Hamas attacks in southern Israel, where militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages.\\xa0', 'Israel launched a retaliatory military campaign, vowing to defeat Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the US, EU and others. Almost five months later, about 130 Israeli hostages are still being held in Gaza.

They said, okay, they want to contextualize and change things. Yet we thought, okay, we get that they have problems there,\" said Azar.', 'Adding context is one thing, but for many, it went too far, she said. \"It felt like someone is telling us how to pray, someone is telling us what words to use in order to describe our situation and how we feel.\"', 'Despite the controversy, her counterparts in Germany stress their solidarity with women in the Palestinian territories.', '\"Of course, we support the World Day of Prayer and are part of the worldwide prayer chain in about 150 countries,\" Ulrike G√∂ken-Huismann, chairwoman of the German committee of the Women\\'s World Day of Prayer, told DW.', 'In light of the October 7 attacks, the planned texts have been \"very carefully and cautiously\" contextualized and adapted, said G√∂ken-Huisman.

But here, not everyone will be able to attend.', 'Accessing holy sites and meeting each other has become more difficult since October 7 for Palestinians. In general, Palestinians from the occupied West Bank have always had to apply to the Israeli authorities for permission to come to Jerusalem.', 'In recent years, Christians from Gaza have only received a limited number of permits to visit relatives in Jerusalem and the West Bank, and then only during Christmas and Easter.', '\"It has been quite difficult. As for our congregations, we have six congregations in the Lutheran Church, one in Jordan and one in Jerusalem and four in the West Bank. And for all these four churches, we can\\'t get permission for them all to meet together,\" Azar said, adding that since October 7, more checkpoints in the occupied West Bank have been closed or had their opening hours limited.
